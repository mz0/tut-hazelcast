More than 5 years later I, Mark Zhitomirski (github.com/mz0) found
this repo in the "archived" state, and refreshed this code, without
claiming copyright for this work. After heavy modifications to the code,
dropping the center-piece of it, and thorough consideration,
I've removed those grant statements for good.

2021-11-25 this code was stripped of `shiro-web` and `shiro-hazelcast`
dependencies, and evolves as a pure Servlet Filter implementation
of the original idea.
